WebGL
-----

WebGL is a technology available in newer web browsers that allows you to display 3D content such as animations and games. In the past, to write a 3D game you would have had to use complex desktop applications, but now we can make a 3D game using nothing but a text editor and a web browser.

Three.js
--------

Three.js is a tool that builds on the WebGL technology and makes it easier create objects in 3D. There are some pretty amazing examples of things you can create on the Three.js website.
