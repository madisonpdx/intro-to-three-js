WebGL
-----

WebGL is a technology available in newer web browsers that allows you to display 3D content such as animations and games. In the past, to write a 3D game you would have had to use complex desktop applications, but now we can make a 3D game using nothing but a text editor and a web browser.

Three.js
--------

Three.js is a tool that builds on the WebGL technology and makes it easier create objects in 3D. There are some pretty amazing examples of things you can create on the Three.js website.

Challenge
----------

Download this example and open it in your text editor (Sublime Text). This example shows a red sphere with a spotlight that lights it up. See if you can make it a blue sphere instead. Then change it to a cube instead of a sphere. Add an additonal light to the scene or try with a different type of light. 

You can use [Adobe Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/) to find the hex values of colors.
